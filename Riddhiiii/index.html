<h2 style="font-style: italic;">Hi <span style="color: red;">Shonaa</span>  of the last 3 months of our relationship this past month has been the closest to my heart <span style="color: red;font-style: normal;">Riddhi</span> we grew alot through this
time and i hope we do more <span style="color: orchid;">(We will)</span>......One of the most memorable moment for me has to be when we would be on the meet and i
would just stare at you cause u looked so pretty in that blue oversized shirt u wore along with ur open hair which would
make even rapunzel <span style="color: orchid;">shy</span>...The way u would write your chem project while i who was supposed to do research couldnt help
but just stare at you cause oh my god how pretty u are... <br> Still remember how u gave me a tour of ur room ahahahha
its pretty ngl but not as pretty as <span style="color: orchid;">you</span> are my <span style="color: red;">love</span>. I adore how pretty you are and the way you smile i adore how u put ur hairtie
on ur wrist while on the call and have your hair open, i adore the way u wear your glasses i adore everything that you do
my love trust me i <span style="color: red;">do</span>...
Oh and did i mention how u made every single person so unattractive to me hahahaha i dont even find anyone else good
looking now u raised my standards very high riddhi i love you always the time we have been together have been the
greatest moments of my life u make me smile and laugh more than anyone else ever has and i have fallen for you very hard
more than i ever did for anyone else.
